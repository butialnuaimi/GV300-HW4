I am interested in applying statistical methods to real-world political and social questions. I enjoy working with R to simulate experiments, estimate causal effects, and communicate results through clear visualizations. My academic interests include experimental design, causal inference, and the ethical implications of data-driven decision-making. I focus on translating quantitative findings into plain-language insights for non-technical audiences. I am particularly interested in political behavior, public opinion, and digital campaign strategies. I aim to continue developing skills in regression modeling, experimental analysis, and responsible data use.
